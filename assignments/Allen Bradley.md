# Allen Bradley Automation Systems
- Bletchley, Milton Keynes

## Roles:		
- Software Engineer
- Unix and VMS Systems Manager
- Oracle and CA DB Database Administrator

## Dates: 	
- January 1990 - September 1992

## Summary:
-	I lead a team of four developers in a client-server based MIS project and coordinated the work with two other teams.
-	I worked on controlling and reporting on printing presses
	*	Using FORTRAN, I created an 'Imposition Map' application that allowed newspaper layouts to be designed and downloaded to Rockwell printing presses
	*	Using programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and embedded software written in PL/M-386 I wrote programs to control 
		*	Speed of paper through printing presses
		*	Spray bar dampners
		*	Ink flow
		* 	ferag grippers
	*	Using FORTRAN and C, I wrote programs to collect data in real time and create charts and graphs for operators to manage the printing process
	*	Using C, I created summaries of real time data to produce management information  reports
-	The project initially used a database supplied by and called Cullinet. 
	*	It was acquired by Computer Associates and renamed CA-DB. 
	*	We continued to use it on the project for a while
	*	We re-evaluated the relational database and chose to adopt Oracle. 
-	The server software was written in DEC Ultrix and VAX/VMS C and the client software in a 4GL supplied with CA DB and which was compatible with Oracle.
-	Besides administering the databases, Unix and VMS hosts I programmed embedded processor system based on i386 CPUâ€™s in PL/M-386. 
-	I wrote programs in FORTRAN on a PDP11 to facilitate data transfer between Allen Bradley PLCs and
	*	Unix
	*	VMS
	*	PDP11
	*	embedded processors (using PL/M-386)
