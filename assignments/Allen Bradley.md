## Summary:
-	I lead a team of four developers in a client-server based MIS project and coordinated the work with two other teams.
-	The project was initially based on a database called Cullinet. This was acquired by Computer Associates and renamed CA-DB and was used on the project for a while; after which we re-evaluated the relational databases and chose to adopt Oracle. 
-	The server software was written in DEC Ultrix and VAX/VMS C and the client software in a 4GL supplied with CA DB and which was compatible with Oracle.
-	Besides administering the databases, Unix and VMS hosts I programmed embedded processor system based on i386 CPUâ€™s in PL/M-386. 
-	I wrote programs in FORTRAN on a PDP11 to facilitate data transfer between Allen Bradley PLCs and
  * Unix
  * VMS
  * PDP11
  * embedded processors (using PL/M-386)
