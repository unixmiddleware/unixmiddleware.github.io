# Capgemini
- Birmingham

## Roles:		
- Oracle Financials DBA
- Performance Tuning Consultant

## Dates: 		
- February 1998 - January 1999

## Summary:
-	Working as a consultant in an FM division of Capgemini I have installed, upgraded and maintained a number of clients Oracle based systems; including NFC, MRC, NIMR, FCS and other divisions of Capgemini including DCS and PBS.
-	I upgraded the Oracle RDBMS for the NFC, National Freight Consortium, enabling them to retain reporting functionality from an old version of the Oracle software (7.1.6) whilst using a newer release of the database (7.3.3). I assisted FCS, a software and services supplier to the NFC, in the upgrade of applications using SQL*Forms v2 to SQL*Forms v4.5, whilst retaining reports for the legacy system. I also assisted CMG in their Year 2000 compliance testing of the NFC production systems.
-	I was at two of the sites of the NIMR, National Institute for Medical Research, one based in Mill Hill, London and the other in Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge. Initially they each used different components of Oracle Financials v10.4, in character mode. I upgraded the system to v10.7 using Smart Client 16.1 and assisted in the resolution of the many problems associated in moving to a client-server architecture. I also, resolved many Business Objects problems for the client.
-	I upgraded the MRC, Medical Research Council, Oracle HRMS applications software from character based, v9.4, to client-server i.e. GUI based v10.7 using Smart Client 16.1. 
-	I converted an Informix legacy system to an Oracle based one including the conversion of many reports to use Business Objects.
-	I have assisted with the rationalisation of database structures and layouts on Novell based Oracle for Virgin Trains.
-	I installed Oracle and AIX on IBM RS6000 and configured the system for best performance as a database server mostly done using command line statements rather than using SMIT. 
-	I have restructured and tuned the Capgemini call logging system, ARS, produced by Remedy Corporation. 
-	I have helped resolve Oracle related problems raised on IBM MVS and RS6000’s (AIX), Apple A/UX, HP/UX, DEC VMS, Novell, Windows 3.11 and Windows NT. 
-	I have setup standardized procedures on a number of client sites that do not have dedicated software for monitoring the system, which examine and report on potential problems with both the server OS and Oracle databases. 
-	I have trained two Oracle DBA’s for Capgemini.
