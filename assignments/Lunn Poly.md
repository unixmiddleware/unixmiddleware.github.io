# Lunn Poly
- Leamington Spa

## Roles:		
- Oracle DBA
- Configuration Manager
- Unix Engineer

## Dates: 		
- September 2001 - February 2003

## Summary:
-	I implemented procedures and processes for producing multiple environments for a three tier application hierarchy for Lunn Poly’s “central platform”. 
	-	The web site can be viewed at (http://www.lunnpoly.com)
-	WebLogic Instances
	-	I configured WebLogic servers to operate in clustered and standalone modes 
	-	To switch between several versions of WebLogic including WebLogic 6.1 and WebLogic 5.1 
		-	with various levels of service packs applied. 
	-	I also made it a simple task to create a new environment simply by adding a new user account. 
	-	I made it so that these systems could switch between various releases of 
		-	Java 
		-	Application software
		-	Oracle versions 
		-	MQ Series messaging systems
-	I implemented a CVS (Concurrent Version System) using a repository on a SUN server 
	-	with client accesses from both Windows NT and other Unix servers. 
	-	I installed and configured MQ Series and the AMI interface with over a hundred service points, 
		-	all done in a way which facilitated rapid deployment and changes. 
	-	I installed and configured 
		-	Java on Solaris
		-	Oracle on Solaris
		-	WebLogic on Solaris
		-	CVS on Solaris
		-	TOAD, an Oracle IDE, on Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows 95 PC’s.
-	I looked after multiple Oracle instances running Oracle v8.1.7 and 9i Release 1 on Solaris, Linux and MS Windows 
	-	Ranging in size from 5GB to 35GB 
	-	Acted as the Oracle expert for the production database managed by a third party. 
		-	This involved both standalone and clustered instances with
			-	Various backup and restore methods 
				-	RMAN 
				-	Direct to tape. 
		-	I wrote several stored database procedures and packages 
			-	handle business logic 
			-	tune and substantially improve the performance of existing code. 
		-	I reduced the deployment time and risk by creating reproducible instances of software 
			-	which allowed immediate fallback in the event of a need to do so.
-	I produced an Oracle cloning facility 
	-	which could clone an instance from a disk copy or from a tape backup using files both local and remote to the instance server. 
	-	I reduced the backup and restore time of several small (~20GB) instances from over eighteen hours to around three hours. 
	-	I provided automated statistics on the top ten poor SQL statements that were sent to developers and DBA’s via email daily. 
	-	I wrote and maintained scripts to load huge amounts of data into Oracle database tables in an efficient manner
