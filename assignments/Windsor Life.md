# Windsor Life Assurance
- Telford

## Roles:		
- Lead Oracle DBA
- Performance Tuning Consultant

## Dates: 		
- July 1995 - January 1998

## Summary:
-	I completely revolutionised the operations activities for Windsor Life, moving them from a desperate fire-fighting situation to a pro-active problem seeking team. 
-	I improved the performance of many of the operations reducing processing time from days to minutes, and automated many of the routine tasks which used to be very labour intensive.
-	Windsor are now able to support over two hundred development and client staff with a handful of DBAâ€™s and Unix System Administrators.
