# Capital One Bank
- Nottingham

## Roles:		
- Oracle Database Team Leader
- Support Team Leader
- Software Engineer

## Dates: 		
- February 2000 - July 2000

## Summary:
-	Due to the rapid growth of the company there was a increasing need for Oracle DBA, Unix SA and man management skills.
	- 	Initially there were eight people in the team, none of whom specialised in Oracle or Unix
	-	The team grew to twenty four members all competent in HP_UX and Oracle
	- 	I am the Technical Architect.
- 	Team Management
	- 	Each team member needed to have an agreed Development Action Plan to be used to assess their progress throughout the year and is used in the pay review procedures.
	-	Each team member needed to have at least five concrete quantifiable goals to achieve within the next year. With each team members’ agreement I changed their existing objectives, which could not be quantified and helped identify achievable goals that also supported the development of the team.
	-	On a weekly basis I met with each team member to discuss their performance that week and for them to feedback anything which could be done to improve their working conditions.
	-	In May of each year each member of the team was reviewed by myself as their manager and up to ten other staff from within and outside their normal sphere of influence. This process assessed their performance against their Development Action Plan and objectives.
-	Project Work
	-	RAID Project one of Capital Ones’ major e-commerce project. It stands for Rapid Application (with) Instant Decisioning. 
	-	I became involved when the original team had problems with the multi-tier architecture. 
	-	Key components of the project included 
		-	Active Server Pages (ASP), 
		-	Java On Line Transactions (JOLT), 
		-	Enterprise Java Beans (EJB), 
		-	Tuxedo, 
		-	multi-threaded and multi-instance server processes and 
		-	online links to credit and referral agencies, Equifax and Experian. 
	-	I resolved many of the issues that arose and pulled back lapsed milestones.
-	Development Manager Tasks
	-	Configuration Management
	-	CSD (Client Services Deveopment) support
	-	Call centre support - 3rd line
	-	SQL training for the test team.
	-	Release Plans
